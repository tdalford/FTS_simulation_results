# FIRST TRY JUST MAKING THIS SIMULATION WIH THEIR DIMENSIONS!!!
# - then could maybe add this dihedral mirror
# then could switch to my dimesions I guess

# Polarizer values value is np.pi / x, not sure how better to do this besides
# decimals..

# If I really wanted to I could change this so that each element has its own
# attributes
# e.g. ellipse has origin, coefficients, angle, center, range
# polarizer has a orientation angle, origin, coefficients
# then there are final mirrors, detector, aperture..
# I should probably do this honestly
